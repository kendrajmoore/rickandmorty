## About the Project

This project is a front-end application that allows users to explore all the characters featured on the popular TV show Rick and Morty. It makes use of the React library to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.

The main goal of this project is to provide a practical example of how to integrate APIs into a React application. By fetching data from the Rick and Morty API, the application populates the UI with information about each character, including their name, species, status, and more.
